This is a project that is supposed to collect offers from stores locally and make them easily searchable. \
The whole thing is pretty rough still, bcs im still figuring out all that web dev stuff.

The monitors currently implemented in the backend are all hardcoded to stores local to me. \
If someone with the knowledge is willing to help, that would be greatly appreciated.
