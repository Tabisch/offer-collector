This is a project that is supposed to collect offers from stores locally and make them easily searchable. \
The whole thing is still pretty rough, but it works.

Im still figuring out all that web dev stuff. \
If someone with the knowledge is willing to help, that would be greatly appreciated. \
The stores-table especially needs some work, bcs it is extremly slow.

Open points:
- add more stores
- implemet better overview in frontend
