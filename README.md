This is a project that is supposed to collect offers from stores locally and make them easily searchable. \
The whole thing is still pretty rough, but it works.

The monitors currently implemented in the backend are all hardcoded to stores local to me, if i had to specify a location. \
Im still figuring out all that web dev stuff. \
If someone with the knowledge is willing to help, that would be greatly appreciated.

Open points:
- build frontend and backend to single docker image
- add more stores
- implemet better overview in frontend
